Social network connectivity.

Given a social network containing N members
and a log file containing M timestamps
at which times pairs of members formed friendships,
design an algorithm to determine the earliest time
at which all members are connected
(i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).

Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp
and that friendship is an equivalence relation.
The running time of your algorithm should be MlogN
or better and use extra space proportional to N.
